A beer that for some reason I thought might be a bit more interesting. However still not much taste to this beer. Rather bland, nothing interesting about it. Its a macro beer!

Pretty taken by taste of this beer. Great fizzy head that disappears fast, but tastes great. Smooth going down, with no bitterness or sweetness. Very light after taste.

The bottle looks good, the beer in the glass also. Starts very mild, almost like water. Modest hoppy-dry aftertaste. Not really a masterpiece!

Classic south-east asian lager, with a lovely pale straw colour.  As with any good SEA brew, very refreshing when ice cold.  Perhaps a bit lacking in depth or substance.

Smooth, drinkable lager. However, I wouldn't buy it again because it is similar in style and taste to many local lagers but much more expensive.

This beer is crisp and quenching and it goes down surprisingly easy but the flavour is not very profound (despite a sugary, overforceful aftertaste)

This is by far the best beer around.  I grew up in Singapore and I was raised on Tiger, so that might explain why I like it so much.  Nothing beats a tall cold tiger draft on a hot night.  try it

Straight forward lager.  No hints of anything significant.  I didn't detect any of the fruit hints.

Pale yellow.  Odd esters in the nose - pear, green apple - always a sign of a failed lager.  Light and watery, with some slight fusel influence.  Unclean, hopless, a total drain pour.
