Quite unpleasant in the taste. Has some notes of old, spoiled malt. Nose is rather typical for every other lager from AB-InBev.

In the style of a German lager. Some good maltiness in the taste, but a little watery and metallic. Only a very mild bitterness in the finish. Not bad, but pretty bland and boring.

The best lager macros you can get in South Korea. Very cheap, and pretty good compared to the other craps.

Had in Seoul on business trip. Prefer Cass just because it was a bit crisper/lighter and worked with the food better. This had slightly more hop character.

Actually, it’s not a pilsner but one of the typical pale lagers. Yellow pour, white head disappears so quickly, a little sweet and bitterless taste, pale flavors of malts and flowers.
