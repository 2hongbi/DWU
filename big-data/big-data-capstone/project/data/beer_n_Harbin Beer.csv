Very little to notice about this beer besides it’s sparkling clear. Tastes thin and watery with a cereal taste. Found everywhere in the country especially at Hot Pot restaurants.

Extra appearance points for presentation packaging. As pale lagers go, it’s average. As Chinese lagers go, it’s tops. Good bittering, light malt, faint hop florals and a crisp finish.

Pale gold, fizzy, head dies very fast.  Aroma rice, corn, wet earth, touch of sourness.  Bites the palate on the way down.  Flavor isn’t offensive, just standard adjunct lager.  Perhaps…

Bottle.  Pours thin gold with little head.  Aroma is corn flakes.  Flavor is sour grass with hop bits.  Palate is average.  I wasn’t expecting much, and I got it.

Clean lager. Very little flavor. Easy to drink, but nothing special. Just a standard larger IMO.

330ml can-pours a foamy white head that reduces to thin.  Color is yellow.  Aroma is sweet, grain.  Taste follows.  Fairly standard for the region.  Dated 6/23.

Bottled.  A very pale lager with a sweet smell and taste.  Not the worse lager ever but still quite boring

Pale, metal aroma, even out of a bottle, and bland flavor.  Not worth drinking, but the other choices in China are usually worse.

Can.  The flavor is fine.  A bit hoppy and slightly fruity.  Had this at a Circle K in Hong Kong.  It said this was the oldest brewery in China.
