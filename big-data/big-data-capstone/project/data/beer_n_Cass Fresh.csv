Can.  I bought this at a Korean grocery store in Hong Kong.  I thought Hite was bad until I tried this.  No head and a light gold color.  The flavor is slightly unpleasant.

Agreed. The least offensive of the Korean brands. More like MGD or Bud garbage.

Refreshing, mostly due to the fact that it tastes like water. Major credit to Brian for finding citrus in this vapid excuse for alcohol transferrance.

The best of the standard Korean beers, or, at least, the least offensive of them. Faint bitter aroma with a short fizzy head which disappears in a hurry. Taste is bland faintly having…
