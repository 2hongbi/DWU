Good representative of a Russian Imperial Stout. Alcohol is strong yet well-backed by deep roasty/malty flavors. Good thick body yet still smooth. Good for a thirsty soul!

Det här var en mycket trevlig upplevelse, kraftig och smakrik som en öl bör vara. Smaken präglas främst av kaffe, choklad och en ordentlig beska. Slutsats: en riktigt god öl.

The best thing about Old Rasputin is its availability. Its the only RIS that can be easily found in four packs or even on draft at certain places. It is a damn good tasting RIS too.
