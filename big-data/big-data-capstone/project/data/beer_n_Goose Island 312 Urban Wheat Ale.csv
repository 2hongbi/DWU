A cloiudy, straw coloured beer with a thick foamy head. A sweet, dry malt scent. Flavour is a little bland but pleasant. A bit malty, a bit hoppy. Easily drinkable but not remarkable.

Grainy wheat nose, a little soapy. Hazy yellow, thin head. Grainy lemony wheat, finishes with unbuttered popcorn. No diacetyl, but corny. Not the best example of the style, but I like it.

Very light with a malt aroma. The beer is pale yellow with a white head. The flavor is very light and thin. A bit of hops to balance the sweetness.

A thin wheat beer with little. Weak foamy head. Basic cascade hop. Had on tap, so maybe the lines were not clean, but the beer tasted tinny.I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt.

Pours a dirty golden color with a tiny bit of head. Smells are rich of wet hay. Taste is a medium wheat/barley taste. Not a bad aftertaste. An okay beer.

I had one of these after finishing a long run.  It was refreshing, and yes, a little watery.  Still, it was tasty and if you’re going to choose a post-exercise watery beer, this is a good one.

Poured from 12oz bottle, pours a hazy light yellow with a thin white head and no lacing, aroma is sweet with some citrus and the flavor is fairly boring with notes of lemon and wheat, meh.

Pours yellow with white head, aroma is fruity and ester filled.  Taste is fruity up front and thins into some malt with a kind of lackluster finish that’s slightly sweet.

Top of the heap as Hefe’s go.  Basically tastes like a hefe without being sweet, which makes it great to me.  Good citrus aromas, nice yeast.  Easy to drink with a full yet clean finish.

An ok effort.  Just letting it sit for a few minutes and warm up made it much worse.  All of a sudden got a little woddy flavor to it and then dissipated.  For Goose Island, I’m let down.

Just a pretty standard american wheat style here. Nothing special about it. It’s got just a slight wheat flavor, and good bite.

This isn’t too bad of a wheat beer.  Not very citrusy, but it still has some fruity flavors.  Very full bodied.

A skunky smelling beer that looks like piss yellow. Not very flavorful and a low palate. Overall I’d say if you want a good wheat ale take Blue moon over this crap.

Light hazy lemon color.  No nose presence or anything.  Flat, nearly tasteless experience.  Some hops and bitterness, but no yeast, no citric flavors.  Watery texture made it easy to drink.
