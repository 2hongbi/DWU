Love, love, love this beer. I like the hit of orange, which when served in the restaurants, they add that slice of orange. It’s light and crisp, and wonderful.

Always on tap.  I love that orange cloudy pour and spice-like citrus aroma.  Cut an orange in half, squeeze and toss it in a pitcher.  Yum.

Bottle.  Aroma is yeasty and of some noble hops.  Flavor is bright, lively and slightly sweet, but never cloying.  Finishes dry, with a lively carbonation.  Pretty damn impressive for Coors.

Light, citrusy, with strong qualities of wheat flavors. Light orange with a light, foamy head. Not bad for a macro.

This beer is unfairly underrated on here, probably because it’s made by Molson.  It’s typical citrusy, spicy, bubble-gummy.  It’s easy to drink.  Nothing fancy, but it’s a solid beer.

I give Coors credit for realizing that they need to try something new.  Some fruit, coriander, and banana odors.  Tastes wheaty, citrusy, fruity, and smooth at the finish.  Not bad.

Coors actually made a beer that has nuances of true witbier.  I'm impressed.  Nice yeasty nose and flavor.  Plenty of malt.  I'm a fan.  Thick ole head, medium bodied.
