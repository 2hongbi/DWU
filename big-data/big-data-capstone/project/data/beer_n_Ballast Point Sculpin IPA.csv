Awesome to see that Ballast Point’s Sculpin is starting to get the attention it deserves. A well balanced IPA combining some light fruit notes with well-rounded hop base.

Aroma of tropical fruits and melon. Piney and a bitter bomb at first. Hop bitters mellow as you go on. I prefer Terrapin high 5 or Two Heart esp at 12-13 bucks a sixer.

Om ölen faller på något är det aromen. Kanske lite på färg och ytterst lite spretig också, men annars sjukt bra. Vilken smak, ett bra djup och en fyllighet som är niiiiice. I like !

Nice IPA, but comes off soapy.  Taste is rather thin and not terribly lasting.  Aroma is standard IPA fare with more sweet fruit than citrus.  Light.
