Tap in a bar in Seoul. Pretty, deep honey orange color. Nose is orange juice, papaya. Sweet, juicy, pithy, zest, with orange, mango and a slightly weird edge. Thick and full. Decent.

extraordinarily turbid. Tons of over ripe mango and muscat everywhere. Super smooth backbone. Big lactos character. Very well balanced and juicy. Excellent
