Nose is hoppier than usual (for a lager): sweet pale malts, a bit of wetboard. Aroma is malty, a bit fruity from the hops. Metallic. Dry, crisp finish. Will do once or twice.

Can at home. Skunky aroma of sweet grainy malt and cardboard with a hint of fruits. Flavour is unpleasantly sweet with a little bitterness in the finish. Too sweet and skunky.

Bottle. Pours a clear golden color with almost no head on it. Nose is a little skunky like a lot of lagers, though it has some nice flavor. Taste is just slightly sweet. Odd. Meh.

Tastes strongly of hay with a light taste of hops.  A smooth finish makes this lager easily drinkable, but certainly not the best Germany has to offer.

Average German lager.  Crisp taste, dry finish.  But, this beer packs a serious hangover.  Don’t plan on doing anything the next day after a night of Beck’s.

Smell is super skunky, and the taste is stale and dusty.  Doesn’t bode well with the light body and moderate floral taste.  A little too carbonated.  Although, perhaps I’m being too hard on this…

I swore this tasted different in Germany. Wasn’t as bad as I had it here. But, I do still prefer it over the norm. In the end, its tolerable. Just another lager, living in the woods.

Skunky, of course. Light on malt but has pretty decent hop presence. Dry, bitter finish. Crisp. This is a simple, mass produced German pilsener, and is kind of boring.

Not bad, not great.  Heneiken is better, but this is better than the Americans.  Still not very good for a German.  Go find yourself a Paulaner.  You'll be glad you did!!!!

Horseblanket aroma. Pale golden, white rocky head that diminishes fast, no lacing. Watery, no maltiness or sweetness, bit hoppy. Finishes more bitter.

With all the great German beers in the world, mass-produced and marketed Beck's would have to be one of the worse. Better, of course than the American fare of BudMillerCoors, but not a…

This is decent when not skunked (which is more often than not, it seems).  Definately a step or two above budmilloors crap.  I drink this on occasion.

Beck's is OK. The thing I like about it is that I think it uses higher quality ingredients than some other low-to-mid range beers.

pale clear golden colour with a fine head, low hoppiness with light herbal notes, medium-bodied, dry and tart with a long herbal finish - a correct pils but there are hundreds better ones…

Much better than American pilsners which isn't saying a whole lot.  A little to hoppy with an aftertaste which lingers in the mouth.  There are much better German Pilsners out there

A decent, light-German beer. Not bad, but then again, not great. Good thing is, it's offered on some airlines (like United). Actually tastes kinda good at 30,000 feet. Well, I guess any…

Beck's is a decent german beer.  It's a little light for my tastes and usually if I'm not going for a dark beer I'm going for a hef but this used to be one of my old stand-bys.
