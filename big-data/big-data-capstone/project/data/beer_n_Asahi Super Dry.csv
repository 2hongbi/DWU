Peppery rubber smell... taste of malt, corn, rice, unpleasant grass aftertaste. One of my least favorite nama, dry alcohol finish. A guaranteed naughty hangover :(

Bottle at a Japanese sushi restaurant. Extremely average lager. Nothing special to remark about it. Just plain simple exactly what the rest of the world would call ’beer’.
