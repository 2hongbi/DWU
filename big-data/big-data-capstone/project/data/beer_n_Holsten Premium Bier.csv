As macro lagers go, this is ok. A thin watery body with a reasonable grassy aroma. Bugger all head but has a lingering bitter finish.

Vary pale yellow with a fairly strong hoppy aroma. The flavor is quite hoppy too, with a bit of grain and menthol mixed in. Better than most North American macro's, but still pretty ordinary.

A yellow beer with a fine dense head. The aroma is slight, but sweet and malty. The flavor is sweet malty with notes of grain and straws. A plain pilsener - OK but nothing special.
