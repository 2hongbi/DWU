Ouch, not good... pale smell and taste. Artificial sweetness. Flat. Watery. Unbalanced. Not nice. ""King of Beers""? Well, maybe in the land of the alcohol-free beers.

Ovviamente va presa come una birra per tutti i giorni, non è per amanti della birra od esperti. Comunque il sapore è convincente, una buona lager per i bbq e le serate tra amici.

If you want to get drunk, this drinks easy (although it will take a lot!).  Sweet corn and a little malt with heavy carbonation to balance.  Very little flavor, very little finish.

pale and no head.  The aroma is slight, but has a little bit of noble hops scent.  There is really no flavor or palate to speak of, just a little bit of bitterness.

Bottle pours a light yellow with a white head that dissipates pretty quickly.  Extremely carbonated.  Tastes mainly of corn and rice.  A good ""lawnmower"" beer, and better than Coors.

It is an average big run brew, not really a beer to savor, but drinkable on a hot day. I wouldn’t buy it, but the choice if Bud, or Coors, or MGD is your only option.

It’s not great, but come on, it’s not bad tasting like some beers I’ve had.  It find It’s actually quite drinkable so I’d rate it about average.  More flavor doesn’t always equal better flavor.

Bud has to be the worst beer in the world.  It’s so watery and bland, but with a strange bitter aftertaste.  Even thought it’s cheap it’s still not worth the money.

I’ll give it this:  The flavor doesn’t ever seem bad, like some other mass market beers.  It’s generally very drinkable.  It’s just freakin’ boring as hell.

Sorry to discourage all you hicks out there, but this beer sucks. Why don't you all go out and get a job so you can afford a real beer. This beer is the reason hicks have sex with their sisters.

If you choose to drink a macro American lager (for whatever reason), Bud may barely make the cut. Typical light, musty, watery and mostly devoid of any substantial malt or hops.
