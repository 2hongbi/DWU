Found on tap at bar in Plainfield, Illinois. Great dark appearance with an inviting tan top. It's a classic for a reason but there are certainly better ones made by smaller brewers.

Nesten helt svart med et silkemykt skum. Kaffe og vanilje i duften sammen med et lite metallisk preg. Kaffe og nøtter i smaken med en lett bitterhet. Myk og behagelig munnfølelse.

The appearace is the highlight here. Nice constrast between the black stout and the white head.  A bit watery.  Generic malt flavour.  Nothing exciting but nothing offensive.

And what a dry stout it is. God bless the irish. Black and great to drink. Ameal in itself. Tastes like Beamish and Murphy’s just not as bitter in my opinion. Nice work again!

Decent beer, but totally overrated and overhyped.  It’s not as good as some stouts that will never get the recognition this gets.

Fad. orholdsvis kedelig dry stout. Men stadig flot og lækker at se på. Med en ok fornemmelse i munden. Men smagen er moderat brændt og i længden både flad og kedelig.

A very dark beer topped with a delightful snow top head. It is an amazing smooth feeling and tasting beer. On the down side the finish is a little long for my liking.

From the nitrous ball bottle ... authentic enough with the waterfall suds and milky head!  This is like drinking chocolate milk!  Vaguely coffee'd and a hint of sweetness.  Excellent.

Jet black with a creamy head.  Roasty, dry aroma.  Light roasty-dry flavor.  Needs a little more body and flavor--I find it too thin for a stout.  Otherwise, it's good for a macro.

Amazing.  As many others have pointed out, a very nice, creamy head with a mildly bitter, slightly roasted taste.  A most excellent beer.  This is the beer of Gods.

Beautiful, the beer looks and smells.  Smooth yes, until you swallow.  Bitter, bitter, bitter.  I just don't get it, why is this the favorite amongst so many of you?

The pour is just part of the experience, watching that wave of tan rising to the top of the glass.  Beer itself is a very dark RED.  If you don’t believe me hold it up to a very strong light.  Very…

This is *the* classic stout.  Guinness is best from the can or served right on tap - the bottle loses some of the texture and appearance and makes the beer taste too bitter.
