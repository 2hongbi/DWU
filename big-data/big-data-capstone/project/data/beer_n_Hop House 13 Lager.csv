For a lager that’s not classed as a craft beer, Hop House 13 is dam tasty. My local ale house has this on tap but I have only drank this from the bottle, next time I’m having this from a keg.

Pint in Courtney’s Killarney. Yellow/golden colour with white head. Minimal aroma - Taste - some kind of hoppiness but very faint. Strangely thin-bodied. No great shakes really.

On tap in Dublin. Yellow color with a small white head. Medium to light body, and medium carbonation. Classic lager but with extra hop. Fruity but not bitter at all. Quite surprising and nice.
