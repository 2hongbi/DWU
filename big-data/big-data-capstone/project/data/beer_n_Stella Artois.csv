Dit bier ruikt chemisch en zurig (mout). De smaak is ook onnatuurlijk en bovenal waterig. Weinig hop of andere smaaklagen te herkennen. Niet zo lekker.

12 oz bottle - It has a definite European aroma to it.  Good blend of malts and hops.  Not a great beer but good for a pale lager.  I had been underestimating it.

This is a decent beer for a macro lager, but it isn’t a great beer itself. It usually comes skunky and provides you with just a bit of grain and a micro kiss of hops.

Bottle, 5,0%. Has a weak sweet taste and no aftertaste. Easily drinkable but often overpriced - you can probably get something better for the price. Just look around.

Horrifying in a bottle due to the green but actually quite good on tap. What Budweiser could be with some effort. Premium generally not worth paying unless its the best thing on tap.

A very nice beer. It is bitter and crisp and you can taste that it is quite strong. However - for some reason it is the only beer of which I can only drink 2-3 bottles until heart burn kicks in.

Classic pale lager, good all around beer to have with pizza, chicken fingers, or simply to just chill out. Little bit of grass, smooth, has some body and not too light...just right.

As for most on tap beers you can get around here, this is usually much better.  Pours a nice head, golden color, hoppy, fruity taste.    Nicely served in 50cl chalice.

Light crisp lager, faint citrus notes. Not much spicing to the yeast, so it doesn’t hold much belgian character, and lacks anything that gives it much character.

Bottle. Very approachable Lager. Golden color with fizzy head that quickly dissipates. Pleasantly bitter aftertaste that is not overpowering.  Crisp and refreshing.

This beer doesn’t suck too hard, but it’s over priced. This is a summer beer. It falls into the same wavelength as Heineken etc.....It’s not very tastey nor special but is better than Pabst.

Nice hops. The malt is a little watery in flavor, with hops being the emphasis. Great head. This is a good lawnmower beer.
