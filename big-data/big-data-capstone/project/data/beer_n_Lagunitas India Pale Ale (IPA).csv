Amber pour with white head.  Aroma of light citrus and caramel malt.  Flavor is fairly strong woodsy citrus and mild pine.  Some caramel malt.  Overall, pretty bitter and dry.  Average IPA.

Mild fruit aroma. Soft amber color. Mild bitterness with a subtle sweetness. Sourness lingers a little but the finish is otherwise clean. Refreshing and drinkable. I would drink this one again.

Just the right amount of bitterness for an IPA. I really, really dig this.

Schmack daddy this was good!  The earthy, piney and toffee aromas leap out of the glass and beg you to take that first sip.  The heavy malt content and hop flavors smack you in the face…

Fruity hop aroma.  Hoppy, fruity taste and very very bitter.  Excellent beer.

A typical IPA hopmonster with a nice, very citrusy malt balance.  Lacks body, though, and seems watery.

I had this one right after Speakeasy's Big Daddy IPA.  This is definitely not as dry and seems to tilt more towards the British style with hints of malty biscuit in the aroma and flavour.  It is…

Bright amber. Bit chewy on the nose with piney hops. Earthu, chewy, moderate bitterness and a touch of bright orange.  Decent IPA - a revelation when launched but definitely dated…

Rocky head above a light apricot color, sans the cloudiness factor. Citrusy, flowery, spicy, and aromatic. Even a little sourness, almost lactic in nature. Solid IPA for sure, but it's…
