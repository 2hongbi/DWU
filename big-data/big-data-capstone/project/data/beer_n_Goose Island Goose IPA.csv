This beer has some really nice aromas of citrus and pine from the hops.  Lots of differing flavors of grapefruit, pine, and mild grassiness.  This is a very nice go to beer.

A favorite IPA. Not quite as robust as some but excellent nonetheless. More on the order of Alpha King than Two Hearted, say. Consistently great, nicely balanced.
