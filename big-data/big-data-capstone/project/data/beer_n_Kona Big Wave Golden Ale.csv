Oh yeah - a Hawaii Ale that is crafty smelling and has little alcohol content with it, that is great. The after taste is the only thing where I would like a bit more. A god easy going beer.

I don’t know what to say about this beer other than that it’s about as average as a beer could be. Not bad by any means, but it isn’t special in any way and it doesn’t have any qualities…

Quenches your thirst but doesn’t do much else for me. Nice golden color and simple on palate - too simple? - but not much on the nose or with the flavor. Good beer for sitting by the pool.
