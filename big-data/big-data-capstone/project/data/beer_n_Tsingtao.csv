Not a bad Asian lager. A little bit hoppy, taste is bitter. Nice to have on occasion. Not my number 1 choice but it was worth trying. I’m not begging for my money back lol.

Basically China’s Heineken, which isn’t saying much. Nothing excting here. Little to no flavor, with the exception of a little skunkiness, perhaps due to the green bottle. A passer overall.

An ok beer from China.  I think this will be my first beer from that part of the world.  Similar to Japanese beers I guess.  I can’t tell the beers apart.  Skunky smell, but taste is fine.

Bottle. Pale yellow with hardly any head. This beer has aromas of skunk, tin cans and flowers, and an insipidly bland rice cracker taste. Okay with spicy Chinese food, but that’s about it.
