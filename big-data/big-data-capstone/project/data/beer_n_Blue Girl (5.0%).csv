Fluorescent yellow.  No head.  Appley nose.  Heavy palate for a swill.  Appley taste.  Some plastics.  Innocuous blandness.

Doesn’t smell much. This is not good. Both ricey and buttery, an untasty beer of the highest order.

Can.  Bought in Hong Kong at Pacific Place’s ""Great Food Hall"".  God, this is awful!  Very metallic, like putting a piece of aluminum in your mouth.  Fizzy and simply atrocious.

Canned. Pale golden with brief head. Aroma of boiled vegetables and glue. Thin and gassy. A horrible mix of wet cardboard, thinner and rotting garbage. Undrinkable!!
